“The modesty of the general title of this series has, we believe,
led many to misunderstand its character and underrate its velue. The
books are well suited sor study in the upper forms os our best schools‚
but not the less are they adapt ted to the wants os all Bible students
who are not specialists. We doubt, indeed, whether any os the
numerous popular commentari nes recently issued' ιιι this country will be
found more servieenble sor general use. ”.—Academy
