' ADDITIONAL NOTES.

P 95 a ovtntr. An interesting memorial of Ovini was discovered
at the end of the last century in the village os Haddenham near Ely, and
was by the advice of the late Canon Bentham removed to the Cathedral

. 5 at Ely, where it is now preserved. Itis a stone which appears to have
'formed the base os a cross, and on one os its sides is the following
inscription.

Tlre letter Ε wherever it occurs is os the Old Saron form, and gives ’

’ evidence ol the antiquity ol the inscription. Fora full account ol the
stone see Bentham's Hist and Antiq eff the Conveni· Ch at Ely, p 51
(ed 1812). The Dean ol Ely (Dr Merivale) suggests that thewords

1 5 are meant for a pentameter line, the m in lucem being elided eyen
before a consonant. I am also indebted to Dean Merivale sor pointing
outa similar instance ol elision in a sepulchral inscription given in
Platner's Bcschreibung der stadt Rom Band 11 p 88.

Constantinus Aug et Helena Augusta Hanc domum regalis simili

20 fulgore coruscans Aula circumdat dcc.

And that a like elision from Ennius is given in Wordsworth’s
Fragments and Specimens os Early Latin p 583.
And in a British inscription in Hubner's Inscr Brit Additamenta
