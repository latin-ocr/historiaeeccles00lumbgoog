IN the same monastery dwelt a brother named Badudegn, whose
25 duty was to attend on the guests. One day as he returned from

the sea where he had been washing the rohes he kept in the guest·
chamher‚ he was smitten down with paralysis and with difficulty
reached honre. When his disorder increased he went to the tomh
of the most reverend father Cudherct aud there praying it seemed as
30 though he had fallen into a sleep‚ during which he felt a large broad
hand touch his head and the parts of his body affected by disease.
When he awolre he rose up perfectly well and returned with great
joyss The garments in which Cudberct’s body had been wrapped
either in lise or death were not destitute of healing powers, as may '
35 he learnt sronr the story of his lise and virtues.
