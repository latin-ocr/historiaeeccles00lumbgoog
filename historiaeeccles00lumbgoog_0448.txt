Rochester, In the same year be consecrated Laurentius to be bis own
successor at Canterbury. 'ibe episcopare of Laurentius was termi-
nated by his death in 6 ¹9 Α D. About two years before that date the
district presided over by Mellitus relapsed into heathendom‚ as also did
that to which iustus had been appointed. William of Malmesbury only 3
says (de gest pontif 11) a successoribus regulis deturbatus Mellilus Cantu-
arr'om venit ibi magno arrarum aestu quae ronanam pectora decopabant
exceptus, coniuncto sibi Iusto, recessit in Galliam. But there was no
bishop appointed to take the place ol Mellitus till Α Ι) 658 when Cedd
was made bishop among the East Saxons, and ·Beda says (111 aal10

On the death of Laurentius Mellitus was made arebbishop and
dying in 624 was succeeded by Iustus, at whose death in 627 Honorius
came to the archiepiscopal dignity, and it is during his episcopato, 15
which continued till 653 An, that the history contained in these two
books commences.

To the bishopric of Rochester Iustus returned one year aster his de·
parture (he116) and continued to preside over the see till his eleva· Ι
tion to the archiepiscopum, when he consecrated Romanus to be his 20
successor. This prelate was drowned in the Italian sea [h e 11 20]
when going as a legate from England to pope Honorius 634 At), and
after him Paulinus at the request oi archbishop Honorius took charge
of the see ol Rochester, which he held for ten years· ,

Paulinus had previously been a bishop in the province of North- 2 5
umbria, having converted king Edwin to Christianity 625 AD and
having been consecrated bishop by arcbbishop Iustus [he 11 9], and
he is accounted the first bishop oi York. We also read ol the extension
of the missionary labours of Paulinus into Lindsey [h e 11 161, buton
the death of king Edwin 633 Α 1> he was obliged to leave the northern 30
parts os the land and came along with Edwin's queen to Kent, when he
was appointed, as has been said, to the bishopric ol Rochester, and the
northern provinces were next evangelised by the labours 'of Aidan who
became the first bishop of Lindissame. No other bishop was appointed
