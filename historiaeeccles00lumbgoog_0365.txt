18] JOHN THE raca-camah. 341

[XVIII]
AT the synod of Hatheld was present John the chief preoentor

oiISt Peter's at Rome, whom pope Agatho had lately sent to

Britain in the company of Benedict Biscop. This Benedict was the

5 founder of a monastery in Britain near the mouth of the river Wear.
The precentor John was sent to Britain that he might teach the course

of church singing according to the use of St Peter's at Rome. He
instructed the dwellers in the above-named monastery and many others
who thronged to learn, in reading as well as chanting. He also en-
10 quired into the belief held in the church of the Angles and reported there-
on to pope Agatho, who desired to preserve the church free hom pre·
waiting heresies. This John, returning to Rome, seli ill and died on the

way and was buried at Tours, at which place he had been enter· ι

tained when he was coming to Britain. A report of the catholic saith of
¹5 the Angles was however conveyed to the pope.
