IN the year in which king Ecgirid died Cudberct was ordained bishop

oi Lindisfarne. For several years he had lived a monastic lite in the
little island of Fame. This man from his earliest youth had a desire ior
the religious lile and first entered the monastery of Mailros, over which .
10 a priest os great virtue and prophetie powers named Boisil was then
provost under abbat Eata. At Boisil’s death Cudberct succeeded him
as provost and laboured much to convert the common people irom their
evil works. For many os them led soolish lives and in a time oi plague
¹ had recourse to idolatrous remedies as though they could obtain health
15 through incantations or spelis. Cudberct laboured hard against this error
and had great influeuce both through his skill in speaking and because oi
the grace oi his counienance. He ieared not to travel in the most inac-
cessible districts and frequently tarried away from the monastery two or
three weeks, dwelling among the mountaineers and teaching them both
20 by word and work. Alter many years Cudberct was removed to
Lindissame where from old times had resided a bishop with his clergy
and an abbat with his monks. This institution had existed since the
time oi bishop Aidan who in the beginning thereos had followed the
instructions received from pope Gregory by Augustine.
