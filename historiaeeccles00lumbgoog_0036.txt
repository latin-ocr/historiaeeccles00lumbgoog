12 EBERT’S AccotJNT OF B'EDA.

as well as the years oi the world, Beda is much more complete
than his predecessor. Britain, as is only sair, is especially
noticed, and particularly in the last decads; thus we find here
also mention os Theodore's mission andos the pilgrimages
of the Angles to Rome. Subjoined to this chronicl'e in the5
treatise ‘de temporum ratione' are four more chapters, where
the author briefly discusses the ‘remainder of the sixth age of
the world'‚ the times ol thet Lord’s advent and oi Antichrist,
the last doomsday, the seventh and eighth ages. ln particular
he here (c 67) controverts the opinion, that the various reckon- 10
ings of the years of the world—accordingto the Hebrew original

‘ or the LXX-could in any way affect the determination ol the

. last d'ay, which as a divine secret eluded all calculation. The
assertion, that alter the lapse ol 6000 years this temporal scene
is at an end, because the millenniums of the world’s duration15
correspond to the siit days ol creation, is erroneous; the days
of creation refer rather to the ages of the world, which by no
means comprise each 1000 years precisely, some being longer,
some shorter. The two surest tokens however of the ap-

proaching judgement are the conversion of the Jews and the 20 t

reign oi Antichrist (c 69). The seventh age os the world is
that os the eternal sabbath, the eighth that oftheblessed resur-
rection. The ages ol the world correspond likewise to Christ's
passion week, and are mystically signified thereby.

With Beda’s chronological studies is connected a tract, 25
which also became of importance for the middle ages: his
