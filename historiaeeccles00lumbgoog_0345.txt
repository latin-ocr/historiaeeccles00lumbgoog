ABBESS HILDILID.

X

EDILBURGA was succeeded in ber office oi abbess by a handmaid

os God named Hildilid‚ and great care was exercised by her ior

many years in the discharge of all her duties. She detennined on

5 account os the want of space near the monastery that the bones os
' those holy ones who had been buried there should be removed into the'
church os the blessed Mother os God, and when this was done bright
lights appeared from heaven, and a marvellous fragrance was felt, as is
told in the work from which Beda makes his extracts. He relates one
10 miracle which took place at that cemetery. The wife of a certain earl
who lived near was afflicted with a disease os the eyes and at last became

quite blind. Thinking that if she were brought to the monastery of these
holy' virgins and prayed near the relics of the saint she should recover,
she caused her maidens to bring her thither. She was perfectly restored,
15 and walked horne by herself as though she had been deprived of tem·

poral light only that her cure might shew what virtue and light belongs

‘ to the saints in heaven.
