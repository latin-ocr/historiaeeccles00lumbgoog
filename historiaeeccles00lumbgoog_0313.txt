10 FTER Suidheim's death, Sigheri and Sebbi were kings orer the
East Saxons. Sigheri with his people, during the great pesti·
lence, forsook Christianity and set up the idol temples once more
in their province· Sebbi however' continued in the true saith. In
consequence of this apostasy king Vulsheri sent bishop Ianuman to
15 recall the people to the saith of Christ, and his preaching was so snc-
cessfnl that the heathen temples and altars were all destroyed and the
Christian churches opened again and the people rejoiced to confess

the name of Christ.
