ING Ecgfrid toolr to wife Aedilthryda daughter of Anna king of

the East Angles. She had formerly been the wife of Tondberct
dulre of the South Gyruii. She lived with Ecgfrid twelve years, but in
both marriages she remained glorious in the integrity of her virginity. 5
lIence it was that aster her death her body remained uncorrupted. She
long entreated to be allowed to retiae into a monastery, and at last
entered that which was presided over by the abbess Aebba at Coludi
Urbs (Coldingham). But within about a year she was herself made
abbess at Elge (Ely) where she built a monastery. She never wore 10
linen after her entry on the monastic life, and seldom used warm baths.
She spent much time in prayer, and was able to foretell a pestilence of
which she herself was to die, and also to declare how many of the
inhabitants of that monastery should die of the same plague. She was
buried in a wooden coffin at first, but her sister Sexburga, who succeeded 15
her as abbess, caused her body 'to be taken up, after it had been buried
for sixteen years, and then it was found to be free from corruption, and

Ι those who were sent forth to seekastone for a new coffin, found a coffin of

marble and alid of the same marvellously put in readiness for them near
the walls of the city of Grantchester. Τὴε physician Cynesrid tells how 20
on examination of the body, the wonnd‚ which he had made by lancing
a tumour on the neck of the abbess shortly before she died, was found
to be healed up. Her garments also were fresh as new. The pain of
her tumour Aedilthryda connted as a punishment for the needless weight
of necklaces she had worn when young and as a sign that God by this 2 5>
chastisement absolved her from the guilt of idle levity. By the touch of
her garments demons were put to flight and diseases cured. Blind
people recovered sight by praying at the wooden coffin. 'lhe marble
coffin was exactly fitted to the body of the virgin. Elge is in the pro·

vince of East Anglia, and is so called from the number of cels that are 30
caught in the marshes there.
