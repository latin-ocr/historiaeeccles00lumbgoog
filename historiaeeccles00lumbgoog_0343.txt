UT when the mother of the congregation, Aedilburga, was to die, a
wondrous vision was seen by one of the sisters whose name was
Torctgyd. This holy woman had been a great help to Aedilburga in
the discipline of the younger sisters. But at length she had fallen sick,

10 and had been ill for nine years. On a certain night, when she had gone
forth from her chamber, she beheld a human body, shining brighter
than the sun, and wrapt iu fine linen, being carried up to heaven by
cords which seemed brighter than gold. She knew by this that some
one of their number was to be taken to heaven for the good works which

15 she had done. And before many days had passed Aedilburga fell
sick and died and none can doubt that the entra'uce into the heavenly
country was opened to her at her departure. ‘

When the body of the holy mother was brought into the church to
await its burial, one m the nnus, of noble birth and still more noble

20 through holiness of life, having been long bed-ridden and unable to
move, asked that she might be brought close to the dead body, and
speaking as though to one alive she prayed the mother to obtain for her
a speedy release from her pains. Her prayer was heard, and twelve
days afterwards she died.

25 T orctgyd lived three years longer than Aedilburga‚ and became
attenuated and so weak that she could not speak. When she had lain
'speechless for three days and three nights‚ she began to converse as if
beholdinga vision, and asked eamestly that her release from the body
might not be delayed beyond the next night. When she was asked by

30 those about her, with whom she had been conversing, she answered
“With my dearest mother Aedilburga’' They then knew that the

' mother had oome from heaven to tell her of the time of her departure.
And when oue day and one night had passed, Torctgyd entered into
the enjoyment of eternal bliss.
