lt must be remembered that the traditions of Beda’s monastery (ha 4
cited above 341 37) regarded the relies of Wearmouth and Jarrow with
1 5 a veneration untroubled by doubt 3 the miracles also of Gregory 1 were
commonly read in English churches (Ioannes Diacon uitaGreg141
opp Greg1u58⁰h Thus (Lingard 11 93) “a taste for the marvellous
was generated and traditions of long standing as well as stories of inore
recent date were often committed to writing as facts by men who, if
2⁹0 they had learned to doubt and examine, would have considered them
as fictions or exaggerations. In this respect the cantion of Beda is
worthy of notice. He relatos several wonderful events, but not one
of them on his own knowledge. To some he gives full credit on the
personat authority of men whose names he mentions, and of whose
25 veracity he can entertain no doubt; of the others he is careful to state
that they come to him at third or fourth hand, or from the tradition
of certain churches3 and with this information he leaves them to the
judgement of his readers*.'’
