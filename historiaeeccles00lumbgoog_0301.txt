HEN Colman saw his opinions rejected he returned to Scotland
to consult with his friends there what he ought to do. Bishop
Cedd adopted the catholic use in his own see. This synod was in
5664 An. Tuda succeeded Colman as bishop in Northumbria, and
Eata abbat ol Mailros was made abbat of Lindist'ame. Γ his Eata
was one of twelve boys whom Aedan had taken imm among the
Angles for special instruction and he afterwards became bishop oi
Lindisfarne. Colman took with him into Scotland some of the bones
10 ol bishop Aedan. The humble style of all the buildings of the com·
munity over which he presided shews the frugality and seli-denial ol
Colman and his predecessors. They kept no money, built no houses
for the reception of the visits os great men, their thought being to
serve God and not the world. Thus men ol religion were held in
15 great veneration, and their preaching and other ministraticus much
songht unto. This continued to be the character ol the N orthumbrian
church sor a long time alterwards.
