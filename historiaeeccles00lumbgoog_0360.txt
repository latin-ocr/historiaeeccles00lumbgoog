HEN Caedualla obtained the kingdom of the Geuissi, that is the ¹

West saxons, he took also the island of Vecta which had been
given up to idolatry. He exterminated all the natives and brought in ,
men of his own provinces. He gave the fourth part of the island to
bishop Wilfrid, who transferred it to one of his own clergy named 20
Bernuin and appointed as his companion a presbyter named Hiddila
Beda relates how two boys, sons of Aruald king of Vecta, fled on the
’ approach of the enemy into the neighbouring province of the Iutes to a
place called Ad Lapidem, but afterwards were betrayed and ordered to
be killed. The abbat of the monastery of Hreutford, Cyniberct, begged 2 5
that he might instruct thern first in the Christian saith Having done
this he baptised thern and they then gladly underwent temporal death. '
When Vecta thus became Christian, there was no bishop at first, but

afterwards Danihel was appointed bishop, who when Beda wrote was λ ’

bishop of the West Saxons. Vecta is situated opposite the South 30
Saxons and the Geuissi, separated by a sea three rniles in width, in
which the two tides of the ocean daily meet.
