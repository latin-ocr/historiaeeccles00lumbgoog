As lateas 1740 sick children were taken to ‘Bede's well’ about

a mile to the west of Jarrow: ‘a crooked pin was put in, and the well

5dry between each dipping. My informant has seen twenty children
brought together on a Sunday to be dipt in this well; at which
also on Midsummer·eve there was a great resort of neighbouring
people with bonfires, music etc.’ (Brand-Ellis popular ant 1813
