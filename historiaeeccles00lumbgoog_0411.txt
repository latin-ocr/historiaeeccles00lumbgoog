FTER Cudberct'a body had been buried eleven years it was taken

up to be placed in a new coffin. Bishop Eadberct charged that

2 5 this should be done on the day of the anniversary of his burial. The

body was found all entire, more like one asleep than one dead. The

vestments too, in which the body was wrapt‚ were oi wonderful

ireshness. News of this was brought to bishop Eadberct in a solitude

to which he had retired ior devotion. They brought him also ¹some oi

30 the vestinents‚ which he kissed with affection, and commanded thern to

put new vestments on the body, saying that the place of Cudberct's

burial would not be long empty. They did as he had bidden, and laid

the new σοίῆ-1 011 the pavement of the sanctuary. Soon after Eadberct

fell sick, and when he died was laid in the grave of st Cudberct, and

35 over it was placed the new coffin pf the saint. At that place many
miracles were wrought.
