EFORE engaging in the battle against Ceadualla, Osuald erected
across and he and his men prayed before it, and their saith
was rewarded with victory. The place where the cross was erected

· 5 was called Helenfelth (Heaven's field) and many miracles are known to
have been performed there3 also water in which chips taken from the
cross have been steeped‚ has restored to health both men and cattle
when they have either drunk or been sprinkled with it. The brethren
of the monastery of Hagustald keep a yearly watch and service on this

10 spot for the rest oi King Osuald's soul, and a church has since been
built there. As an instance oi the miraculous powers of this eross and
all things connected with it, Beda relates the eureos the broken arm of
one oi the brethren at Hagustald by means os some moss brought to
him from the cross by one of his sellows.

15 This chapter is cited in Amalar Metens eccles off 1 14 (Migne cv.

will be able to overthrow many testimonies of holy Scriptures, which
God forbid. And if any one shall choose to disparage (rsuccensere) this
present deed, he appears to rebel against God who bestowed this power

30 on the wood of the holy cross‚ that it not only for the present gave the
victory to his servant, but also in later time worked miracles by the
merits of the holy cross. But it' any one shall say: “ Why do you not
adore the ass, because the Lord sat on it, or other such things, which
the Lord touched with his body?'’ I reply secundum paruitatem marm,

35 that Ι do notread on the authority of holy fathers, that miracles and
healings were displayed from them, as by the power of the holy cross;
