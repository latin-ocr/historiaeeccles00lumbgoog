'l'this time the monastery called Coludi Urbs was consumed by sire
' forthe wickedness of those who dwelt in it. These like the Nine-
vites had been previously warned. For Adamnan, a Scottish monk of
5 great strictness os lise, soretold the coming fire. This man in his youth
had committed some great wickedness. He went to a priest and
conlessed, and by the direction os the confessor he was ordered to be
instant in tasting and psalms 'and prayers. His great gries made him
anxious to submit to more penance and he proposed to his consessor to
ιο spend the whole night in prayer, standing, or to pass the whole week
in abstinence. The priest imposed a somewhat lighter penante ancl
departing to lreland there died. Adamnan continued regularly the
penance which had been imposed‚ so that he took sood only on the fisth
day os the week and on the Lord’s day. When he had diligently pur·
15 sued this course of lise sor a long time, he went ior some distance t'ronr
the monastery, aocompanied by one os the brethren. As they were
returning, Adamnan foretold to his companion that the whole building
would soon be reduced to ashes. For, said he, I lately saw while occu·
pied in my vigils a vision ol one who told me that l did well, but that
zottone of the other members of the monastery were occupied with care
t'or their souls. The cells, said he, are made into places sor revelling
and drinking and other allurements, and the nuns wlrenever they have
leisure spend their time in wearing fine garments sor their adornment.
Wherelore this place shall be burnt with raging flames. When asked
²5 hy the abhess why he had so long kept silence, he said, I seared to
speak lest you should be too much troubled, but the stroke shall not
fall in your days. Some little reform followed the publication of this
vision, but when the ahbess died they again returned to their old way
os lise. Therefore while they spake os peace, sudden destruction came
30 upon rhem. Beda relates this on the authority of Aedgils a sellow
presbyter, to admonish people how terrible the Lord is in his counsels
concerning the sons os men. ⁵
