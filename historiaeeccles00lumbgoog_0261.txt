ΒΕΑ ΤΗ OF OSWALD. ²37

VIIII

SUALD reigned uiue years, for iu his reign was included the one

year os his apostate predecessors. Hc was killed by the king of

the Mercians in a battle at Maserlelth. The place where he died has
5 been made illustrious by miracles. The dust of the earth there, when
mixed with water, has healed both men and beasts. The place has
become so noted that by taking away the earth there has been made
a hole as deep as a man is high. Beda gives two instances os cures. A
traveller riding near the place found his horse suddenly taken very ill,

10 and expected it to die. But in its struggles it happened that the animal
rolled on to the spot where Osuald had been killed, and it was at once
restored to its wonted strength. Τὴε man journeying on, and deeply
impressed with the sanctity os the spot, came to ari inu, where the niece
of the master was paralysed. He told of the wondrous cure os his horse,

15 and straightway they conveyed the sick girl thither and laid her down.
She fell into a sleep and awoke quite restored, so as to be able to wash
herself, dress her hair, and after that walk home with the friends who
had brought her.
