to ascribe to it, and even if we must recognise in Beda
the high culture of the Roman church, rather than Anglo·
Saxon nationality‚ yet the acknowledgement which his
merits found in Rome during his life, and, shortly alter
5his death, whereever learning could penetrate, proves that
in him we justly venerate a wonder of the time. his
numerous theological writings ...... throughout many ages,
until the total revolution in that branch of learning, found
readers and transcribers in every cloister ol Europe. his
ιο knowledge of Greek, of medicine, of astronomy, os prosody,
he made subservient to the instruction of his contem-
poraries; his work ‘de sex huius saeculi aetatibus’, though

less used than it deserves to be, is the basis of most ol Ι

the universal chronicles of the middle age. but his greatest

15 merit, which will preserve his name through all future
generations, consists in his historic vorke, so far as they con-
cern his own native land. if a second man like himself had
ariscn in his days, who with the same clear, circumspect
glauce, the same honest and pious purpose, had recorded

20 the secular transactions of his forefathers, as Beda has
transmitted to us those chiefly of the church, then would
the history of England have been to posterity almost like
revelation for Germanic antiquity.
