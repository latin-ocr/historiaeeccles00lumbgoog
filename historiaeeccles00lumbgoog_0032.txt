'8 EBERT’S ACCOUNT OF BEDA.

to England the papal arch-obanter, who became in the first

“ instance the teacher ol his monastery, in particular ol our Beda;

but from all English convents monks resorted to him to learn
singing. Thus Benedict promoted England’s civilisation in the

· most various directions, and Ceolfrid emulated his example. The 5

picture of these admirable men appears in their scholars beauti-
ful tract the more serene, as no sort of miracle is recorded of them.

Another supplement to Beda’s church history, to which, as
of much earlier date, he also alludes in the course of it, is the '
book DE VITA ΕΤ MIRACVLIS s CVTHBERT1 EPISCOPI mimis-10
FARNENSts. This prose work, undertaken at the request os a
successor of Cuthbert's‚ Eadlrid, andos the monks ol Lindis·
farne, adopts here and there the language ol an earlier work
of Beda's‚ a poem nn MtRAcvnrs s cvrnnnnrr. It is not
however amere version of this-latter, butan independent work, 15
as appears even from the prelace. Beda, as he there assures
us, had taken all pains to report the truth, having fi'rst com·
municated his manuscript to some monks long intimate-with
Cuthbert, and then submitted a copy revised in accordance
with their judgement to the criticism ol a meeting ol elders and 20
teachers of Lindisfame monastery, who however found nothing
further to alter. The difference between the subject-matter of
the prose life and the poem is correctly indicated by their titles ι
in the latter only the miracles are recorded, while the former
embraces in addition the remainder ol the saint’s life: Beda 25
had indeed promised such a supplement in the preface tobis
poem. As regards the subject-matter therefore, it will suffice
here to notice the prose work, the poem, as regards its form,
being reserved for later consideration. The main source how·
ever, from which Beda drew his materials, is still extant, a life⁴3o
of the saint by a monk of Lindisfame.

Still Beda's vrrn emananti, in spite ot all well-meant
precautions in th'e interest os historic truth and in spite ol the
citation of eyewitnesseS, is distinguished from his VITA AB·
RATVM, as a historical romance from history. The romantic 33
