“ LIFE OF CUTHBERT. 9

clement lies in the miracles, which play here, as in the poem,

a principal part. Not only are the most natural things wrested
into miracles, but all the saint's trances, who like St Martin
believed that he was often visited by angels and devils, pass
scurrent as simple truth3 to say nothing ot' his sympathetic
cures. On the other hand however the book is not wholly
devoid of real historical facts, which give it greater worth. Thus
we read (c 9 sqq) how Cuthbert as provost oi Melrose at the
time-os the plague withstood the general relapse into heathen
ιο superstition by journeying alone sormonths through the country
preaching, or how, when transferred to Lindisiame, he intro-
duced a stricter rule into this monastery afterwards so famous,
or lastly how as a hermit in the rocky islet Fame heled a
solitary Robinson-Crusoe kind oi lile (here depicted in all detail),

15 to be summoned from thence to the most momentous political
deliberations (c 24l, or to the bishop's throne (nn 685), which
however he filled only two years, then to return to his hermitage.
As Beda grounds this prose lise of a saint on a poem oi his

own, so too, probably at an earlier date, he wrote on the basis

as he says in the pretam, the hexameters ol Paulinus were more
accessible to ‘metrical’ than to plain readers. For the benefit of
these latter, the great majority, he had executed the work on the

¹ model os the prose metaphrast ol Prudentius’ hymn on Cassianus.

literary history, was composed by Beda This work, whose
influence in the middle ages was still more extensive than
that of his church history, belongs to a region oi strictly
