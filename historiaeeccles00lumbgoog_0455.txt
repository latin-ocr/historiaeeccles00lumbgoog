P413 14 The MS has been thoroughly described and a sacsimile page

10 oi it published by the Palaeographic Society (piare 139). The page pro·
duced in faesimile is part of chap 24 of bk 1v nullus eum aequiparare
...... ad abbatissam perductus iussus est, and the Librarian os the Uni·
rersity oi Cambridge (Henry Bradshaw, Esq MA) has given in his
description many particulars of the history oi the volume, together

15 with an account os the quires, ruling, handwriting and abbreviatione
which occur in it.

The sacsimile page contains, as will be seen, the account of the
miraculous gift of song bestowed on Caedmon‚ and as the scribe in
this Ms concluded his work with the original AngloSaxon of Caed-

20 mon's song the society has produced (on plate 140) a {assimile oi that

poem which we here subjoin.

Nu scylun hergign hesaen ricaes uard metudaes maecti end his

modgidane uerc uuldur sadus sue he uundra gihuaes eci dryctin or
astelidae he aerist scop aelda barrium heben til broie haleig scepen.

²5 tha middun geard moncynnaes uard eci dryctin aester tiadae firum

This poem fills three lines of the MS and then follows Primo can·
tavit Cacdmon istud carmen and then four words which are glossed‚
viz. arula . hearth

3> destina . seur
stud . jugulum
sticung . nota rubrica
