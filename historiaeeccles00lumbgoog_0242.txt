HEN Oswald was settled in his kingdom he sent to the Scots,
among whom he had so long lived, and begged them to send him
a bishop who might instruct his' people in the Christian saith. 'lbey 20
sent him bishop Aedam a man 01 exemplary piety, though he still
kept Easter after the custom 01 the northern peoples and not according
to Roman use. His see was established in the island 01 Lindisfarne,
and he laboured eamestly 101 the spreading 01 the saith. The king
osten acted as interpreter when Aedan was preaching, 101 the bishop 25
had not mastered the English language. Many clergy came afterwards
from the country 01 the Scots into England, and churches and monas·
teries were built 111 good number. Aedan was a monk 01 the famous
monastery 01 1111, which island had been given by the Picts to the
Scottish monks a long while before. 30
