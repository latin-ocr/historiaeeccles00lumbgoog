tains beside Beda's eccl hist a Latin ms in two different hands of the
lives of St Basil, St Euphrosyne, the passion of St Agnes, passion of

St Vincentius, passion of St Thomas of Canterbury, passion of St Lan·
rentius, the end of which is wanting. Then follows the Saron version

of Gregory’s Pastoral ascribed to king Alfred. Of this the first folio 5
ts missing.

In the ecclesiastical history, the prologue (there called prefatio)
ends with mandare studuimus, the last sentence of the earliest form
of the prologue, praeterea omnes......inueniam, being placed at the end
of the catalogue of the works of Beda which closes boolr v.¹ The sen· 10
tence preceding it ends, as does the oldest form of bools v, with sertrper
malefaciens ticam.

In book lv chapters x111 xlv xv are thrown into one, xlx and xx
are kept distinct. Chap 28 of the present text is made into two chapters
by a division after dei refectiomm praebebat and the last clause duobm 15
autem annis is transferred to the following chapter.

After the eccl hist follows the letter of Cuthbert de transr'tu (here
called de obitu). It includes the Saxon passage, but does not give the
Latin version thereof: quod ita latim sonat...iudicanda flectit

With verbal variations the letter continues down to ineruditio lin· 20 p
guae facit, omitting the last sentence of the earlier form. This us is of
the xivth century.

C’ is a quarto belonging to Trinity college (R 7 5t of the late ele-
venth oi early twelfth century. The hand is very similar to the speci·
mens no 60 and 62 of the Palaeographical society's issues. On the first ²5
solio is the name Matthaeus Parker.

The prologue ends at mandare studuimus and at the close of boolr v
after ante facim tuam comes the sentence which in the earliest copies is
in the'prologue praeterea enims ...... intercessiones inueniam. Immedi-
ately follows a short account of the island of Lindisfarne‚ and then some 3⁰
rude lines called progrwstica concerning the archbishops and bishops of
England, some of which seem to be anything but complimentary as
that on

Willelmus Norwicensis episcopus: Non hunc sed barraban.

or ‘Theodwald of Worcester:

In eadem domo manete edentes et bibentes.
Chap xm of boolr ιν does not commence in C¹ till Erat autem ibi
