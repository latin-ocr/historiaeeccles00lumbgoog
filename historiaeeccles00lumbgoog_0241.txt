And thus as Onesimus and Eutychus were so called from their infancy,
but never truely answered their names, till alter the conversion of the
one, and reviving of the other: so places (whether casually, or pro·

times verified many ages aiter’.

ibid 11 the Romans dwelt south oi this uallum, as is witnessed ‘to this

10 day’ by their citios, lighthouses, bridges and roads. The passage herc
quoted (supra) is ibid ια (stom Gildas) aiter the retirement ol the
Romans (A n 409) from Britain, the Britons suffered greatly from the
incursions oi the Picts and Scots (the barbari here meant). On their
piteous appeal a legion was sent, which drove back the invaders and,

15 on leaving the island, urged the Britons to build a stone wall from sea
to sea. Having no engineer eqaal to the task, the Britons only raised
a uallum oi turf. Again they appealed for help, again a legion is sent,
which built a solid stone wall on the line of the uallum ol Severus, 8 lt
broad and ra high, hactenus famarm atque conspicuum. See also

such fortification was raised in Britain. The wall of Hadrian runs
from Wallsend on the Tyne to Bowness, almost due E aad W, to a
length os 73} miles. It consists of three parts: the uallum (mound oi
30 earth and trench), a stone wall with towers at intervals and smaller
forts οἱ distances os about a mile ; stations or larger forts mostly between
the murus and uallma. Gildas (ci Beda) has wrongly assigned these
three parts to three separate dates Beda would have the wall con·
stantly in view, as Jarrow lies at the mouth oi the Tyne. Varin (106-
35 rao) analyses at great length Gildas and Beda, and gives far too much
weight to their evidence.
