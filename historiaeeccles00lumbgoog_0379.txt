IN the ninth year ol king Ecglrid a battle was fought near' the

river Trcnt between him and Aedilred king of Mercia. There a
brother ol king Ecgr'rid was slain, named Aelluin. The war seenred
likely to grow fiercer, but through ,the exhortations ol archbishop

20 Theodore the two kiugs and people were appeased and no man’s
lile taken for the king’s brother who had been slain, only his wergyld
pald to king Ecgirid.

30 ‚‚ 30 Tunnnrn because in Will Malmsb the name of the
prince killed in this battle is given as aeduinus, Smith inclines to
place the battle-held. in Yorkshire near Hatficld, but there seems to
be greater probability in the suggestion ol Ellord (ie Aellwin’s ford)
on Trent as rhc sceneos the battle, and Gibson in his additions to

35 Camden col 537 describes a' tumulus which may perhaps have been
ereeted to commemorate this event.
