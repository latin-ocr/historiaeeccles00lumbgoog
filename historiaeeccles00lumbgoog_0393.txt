This goes a little beyond the Latin text os Beda and seems to have

15 formed part oi some poem in his day known as Caedmon’s first song.
but it differs greatly from the introduction of Caedmon’s Genesis which
has corne down to us, though it is like it in subject. In his note to the
Saron version Smith gives a copy oi the above lines srom Bp Moore's

trs with some various readings oi interest, the needsul word roeorc
20 being there given, though notin Alsred's text as edited by Smith.

‚the name of Caedmon are Genesis, which cousins, aner the account oi
the creation the fall and the flood, mainly oi the history os Abraham,
very little being said oi the latter part oi the book oi Genesis; the story
oi Euodus, which is carried down to the departure from Egypt; and
35 that portion oi the book of Daniel which relates the story of the three
Hebrew children and the interpretation oi Nebuchadnezzar's dream.
. Oi the other works enumerated in Beda’s text we have no trace, nor are
all these which have been preserved to be considered the productioris oi

the time oi Caedrnon.
