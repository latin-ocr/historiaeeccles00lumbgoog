EXCURSUS IV

BISHOPRICS BRITISH AND SAXON -
BEFORE 64οΑιι

OF the episcopare in Britain before the arrival of St Augustine we
5 have very little information. We know that British bishops were
at the couucils ol Arles (315 no) and of Ariminum (359 nn) but we
have no name ol either bishop or see till the time ol Ninias who at the
opening of the filth century (401 an) was bpof Casa Candida, ie
¹ Whitherue in Galloway (see p aaa). But the Brittsh bishops, like the

gradually occupied by the Saxons and ιιι 871 AD we even find a Saxon

¹ bishop at St David's [archaeol Camb 3rd series xp 15 quoted' ιιι

condition ol the Saxon episcopate from the arrival of Augustino down

same year and held the archiepiscopal see till his death 604 ιιι).

2 5 During his life the monastery of St Peter and St Paul, al'terwards
called St Augustiue's‚ was commenced but not completed, and in the
year of his death he consecrated Mellitus and Iustus, who had been sent
over to him from pope Gregory, the former to be bishop among the
