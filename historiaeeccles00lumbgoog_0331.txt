2 5 WHEN Colman lest B1itain, he first went to the island oi Hii with
his Scots and the Angles, about thirty in number, who were his
companions. Alter a time, they removed to another island on the west
ol Ireland named Inis-boufinde. Here he lived with his company of
monks partly Scots and partly Angles; but they did not agree together,
30 sor the Scots wandered away in the summer time when the crops were
to be gathered, but came and desired to live on the labours of the
Angles in the winter. So Colman found a place in Ireland called
Mageo suitable sor a monastery, and buyinga piece ol land there from
the earl to whom it belonged, he built, with the assistance of the said
35 earl and those who dwelt near, a suitable house and brought thither the
Angles and left the Scots behind. This monastery is still occupied by
English, and is now called Muigeo and has an excellent company ol
monks who live under a rule and canonical abbat.
