VII

HE monastery of Barking was made famous by many heavenly
signs. One of these Beda relates. At the time of the mortality
which has been so osten mentioned, the disease first attaeked the monks
and many ol the brethren died. It then spread to the sisters and the 15
mother ο1 the congregation asked anxiously of those who were sick in
what place they would desire to be buried if they should be taken
from the world. From them she had no answer, but one night after
matins were ended and these haudmaids ο1 Christ had gone out ο1 the
oratory‚ a bright light came down lrom heaven and resting on a spot to 20
the south ο1 the monastery marked that place out as divinely appoinked
lor the burial- place. This radiance was greater than the light of day,
and was noticed by one of the brethren as making its way through the
chinks ο1 the doors and windows‚ and he spake ol it on the following
morning. 25
