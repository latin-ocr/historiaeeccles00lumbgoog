Ι6 ERERPS ACCOUNT OF BEDA. Ι

ground for doubt. The most eminent clergy of the several
provinces aided his undertaking3 one brought him also from

of tradition, which, as he himself says in his preface, is ‘ the
true law of history’. Moreover Beda appears throughout this
work as a master of the learning of his times, with whose com·
prehensive knowledge probably no man then living could vie3
he can discover and appreciate what is really important, though 10
noless a dupe to the current saith in miracles than the far more
ignorant and unenlightened historiari of the Franks. If in his
opinion also (as the preface tells us) the worth of history is prin-
