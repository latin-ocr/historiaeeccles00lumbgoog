day or to the eve of Ascension day? There has been uncertainty as

to the year of Beda's death from the earliest times. All copies of the
Saxon chronicle agree on 734 A 1> which date is repeated by Matthew
Paris (Rolls‘ series vol tp 335) and by Richard of Cirencester(vol 1 p a 37).
Roger of Hoveden (vol 1 p 5) gives the traditional date 735 A 1), while 5
the annals of Wauerley (ann monast 11 155) place Beda's death in
730 A n, and the annals of Worcester (ann monast 1v 367) in 7²⁰ A n.
Fordun (chron gent Scot lib iii c 46) marks the date according to the
year of King Ethfyn, who began to reign, as Fordun states, in 730 A n.
llis words are: Eius anno secundo nel, ut uolunt quidam, anno quinto, 10
Beda uenerabilis obiit. But in Mr Slrene’s notes to Fordun we find
that the year of the commencement of Ethfyn's reign is uncertain, and

it appears from Tighernac that Murdac the predecessor of Ethfyn did
not begin to reign till 733 A 1> and reigned 3 years3 thus Ethfyn would
corne to the throne in 736 or 737 and his second year would be 738 or 15
739 A ι), while his fifth would be 741 or 742 A 1). Baronius taking
vu id mai for the correct reading places the death in 776 A 1),
though it is difficult to see why. There is therefore a great un-
certainty in all our records concerning the year of Beda's death,
and against this we have the testimony ofa trs of the 9th century 20
that the day of his death was 9th May, and snat this day was Ascension
eve. Nothing is more likely than that after the canonisation persons
remembering the story that he died on Ascension day, which would

be the form that tradition would assume, would seek for a date near
the time when he must have died which would square with their 2 5
tradition. But forgetfnl (or ignorant) of ¹the fact that what was called
Ascension day was really Ascension eve, they fixed ,on 735 A n, a year

in which May 06111 was Ascension day. So that we may lay that date
(735 A n) aside altogether, because Ascension eve in that year was
May a5th. Now Ascension eve between the years 730 and 800 was on 30
May a6th only in 751, 762 and 773, all of them ,years too late in the
century for usto assign the death of Beda to any of them. We may
therefore give up vtt kal iunii altogether. When we come to consider
tlte other date, May 9th, we find that Ascension dayfell on that day
only in 7ao and 799, both impossible dates, but Ascension cue was 35
on May 9th in 731, 742, 750. The first year is too early, for Beda’s
history continues till that date, and the third too late for the year in
which Beda died; we therefore are shut up to A 1> 742, aud ou the 9th

of May in that year we conclude that Beda’s death occurred.
