-5. Maria of Agreda (†1658) authoress of the ‘spiritual city of God ⁹,
famous for her visions‚ by wearing a cilicium of rough wool covered 5
her body with sores (Zbckler Gesch d Askese Fr a M 1863 p 87, where
ismore on hair shirts, such as Wolsey More lady Margaret wore, and
iron belis, such as we find in Bonif ep p 60 end, Jaffe‘). So in the life

¹ of St Bridget prefixed to the “Myroure of oure Ladye'’ (EETS) p lii, ‘she
never used any lynen eloth, though it were in time of syclrnes, bnt 10
oonly upon hir hed, and next hir skyn she weer ever rough and sharpe
wolen eloth) For other examples of¹ the expression to go woolward
the reader may see Christ’s own Complaint l 502 (EETS vol 15) ‘to
faste and goo wolle warde ‘, also the same words are found in Hampole’s
Priek of Conscience l 3514. Palsgrave defines it ‘Wolwarde without 15
any lynen next one's body. Sans chemyse? The expression is found in
Pierce the Ploughman's credi 1788, ‘werchen and wolward gon ’, but
the explanation of the last syllable is, 1 think, to be referred to the
word wear, and not as Mr Skeat suggests, with the wool towards the
skin, an explanation which would only suit with a clothing made of the 20
fleece as it came from the sheep’s back. Ward is wered the part of ’
werian=to wear, and woolward means “woolclad‚’' just asin Beowulf
606 sweglwered means “clad in brightness.’' scirwcred and ealdowered
may be cited as other examples of this participle in composition. It
has fared with woolward, when it became a solitary instance of this 2 5
eompound, as it did with militavere under similar circumstances. The
love for uniform orthography made this latter word into rigiratus, and
woolwered into woolward to conform to the shape of fhtward and such
like words. The use of go is the same as in the expressions “to go
bare, heled, cold &c.” We can find no evidence that sheepskins with 30
wool on were ever worn in England or elsewhere for penauce.
