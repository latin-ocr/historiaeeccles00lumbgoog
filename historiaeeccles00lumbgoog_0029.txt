CHURCH HISTORY. S

,first purgatory-where however cold is paired with beat-next
hell, a pit shooting forth incessantly fireballs‚ wherein, as they
rise and fall, the souls of the evil flash as numberless sparks3 then
a fragrant, flowery meadow, wherein walk crowds of men arrayed

Restored to life the Northumbrian entered a monastery, where
