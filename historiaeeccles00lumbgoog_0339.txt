deposed by archbishop Theodore, and Sexwull the founder and
. abbatos Medehamstedewas consecrated in his place. Vynfrid retired
to the monastery ο1 Adbaruae where he died. Theodore mede Earconuald
bishop of the East Saxons. This was a most holy man, so that
10 even the litter in which he was drawn about in his leeble age cures
many that are sick when they are put under or near it. Splinters from
it have also a great and healing virtue. 'Ihis Earconuald, before his Ι
consecration‚ built two monasteries, one for himself at Chertsey, and the
other for his sister Aedilburga at Barking. She was os the same piety as
15 her brother, and took great care of those who were under her in her
monastery, and heavenly miracles gave evidence to her holiness.
