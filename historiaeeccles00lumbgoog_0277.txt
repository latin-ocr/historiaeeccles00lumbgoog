ΙΝ the reign of king SIgberct Furseus a holy man from Ireland came

to the East Angles, and converted much people by his preaching.
¹ This man was seized with a great sickness during which he beheld nn
sangelic vision, in consequence of thch he made all speed to builda
monastery on land given to him by the king. This was at Cnobheres-
burg. Anna afterwards enriched the monastery by his grants In the
monastery where he lived Furseus was transported from the body and
beheld the countenances of the heavenly host. And on his recovery
ῐο from his trance he told of the songs of the angels. On the third day
, after he was again taken away ln spirit and saw not only the J'0ys of
heaven but theutorments of the evil spirits. This account is all recorded

in the book of the life of Furseus.
Beda however inserts one part of the story, and this he does because
15 it seems usefnl. When Furseus was rapt from his body he was bidden
to look back on the world, and he saw a dark valley and four fires in
the air. What these fires were the angels explained to hirn; and soon
they became joined together into an immense flame. Fursens was
territied as the fire came near to him, but was told by the angel that the
20 fire which he had not kindled would not burn him. The angels could
pass through the flame, and in the midst were demons preparing fiery
war against the just. He saw evil spirits and just, and the souls of holy
men of his own nation who spake unto him things of wholesome import.
When F urseus was near the flame the evil spirits cast against him one
25 whom they were tormenting in the tire, and thereby his shoulder and
jaw were burnt. This happened because F urseus had received the gar-
ment of this sinner when he died. When Furseus was restored to the
body he bore a visible mark of the buming, and when he related his
visions, as he was wont for those who asked him to do so by reason of
30 their own troubled consciences, even in the coldest westher, he was as
hot asin the heat of summer. F urseus afterwards became an anchorite
and ln the end retired to Gaul, where he built amonastery at Latine-
acum and there he died. His body was kept by Ercunuald the patrician
buried in the porch of the church which he was building at Perrona,
35 till after the dedication. Then it was placed ina tomb near the altar.
His body was again moved four years after and found lo be incorrupt.

' The full history of Fursens may be found in the book of his life.
