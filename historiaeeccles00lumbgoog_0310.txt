AS archbishop Deuadedit was dead, the kings Osuiu and Ecgberct
chose the presbyter Vighard as fit to be archbishop and sent him

to Rome to be ordained, and that he afterwards might ordain other
bishops for the churches in Britain. But Vighard died at Rome before 5
he could be consecrated, and the pope Vitalian wrote to king Osuiu, -
exhorting him to follow the rule ol St Peter in the keeping of Easter,
and promising, as soon as he should be able to lind a fit man, to send a
bishop to preside over the British church and to instruct the people. He
deplores the death os Vighard and sends hythe hearers oi his letter some [ο
relies as presents to the lring and his queen. Lastly he exhorts him to
labour lor the spread os Christianity through the whole island os Britain.
The account ol him who was sentin Vighard‘s stead is reserved sor the
next book.
