ABOUT this time sigberct, brother ol Earpuald, was king of the
East Angles He had been an 'exile in Gaul, where he was'
baptised, and he introduced into his kingdom such schools and teachers
as he had soen in his exile. He was assisted in this by bishop Felix.
20 After a time he resigned his kingdom to a kinsman Ecgric and entered
a monastery os his own building. He was brought from his retirement
to encourage the army when Penda king oi Mercia was waning ou
East Anglia, but both he aud Ecgric were slain in the battle, sigberct
- having carried uo weapon with him. After them Anna became king
25 in East Anglia, and was in the end slain by the same Peuda.
P 51 ιι anurvurnvu ιι 15 the father Reduald had been baptised in
Kent, but relapsed into heatheuism.. Earpuald was induced by Edwin
to embrace Christianity with his whole province 3 which however, aiter
the murder of Earpuald by the pagan Ricberct, remained in error sor
3ο three years, till Sigberct uir per omnia christianissimus atque doceari-
mus (who had lived in Gaul during his brother's reign) became king,
and by help of Felix, first bp ol Dunwich, won back his province to
the saith. Felix was bp 17 years, and was succeeded by Thomas, hp
5 years, and he by Berctgils or Bonisace. All three were consecrated
35 by Honorius, who died 30 Sept 653 (ιιι ιο). Thus the latest date sor
sigberct’s accession is 631. See martyrol Angl ²7 Sept. martyrol Gall
