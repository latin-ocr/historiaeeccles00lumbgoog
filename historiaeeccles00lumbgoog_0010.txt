increascd¹, may suffice to prove the high esteem in
which Beda has been held wherever he hasbeen
known. His preface shews that his thirst for ori-
ginal evidence was sar more keen than that of many
professed critics; chronologers will know how to
prize the advance made in their science by hi'm,
who introduced into history the one fixcd date A D.

Ι The attention of scholars has os late been recalled
by Ronsch, Paucker‚ Schuchardt and others, to the

mass oi valuable material, lexicographical and other, ⁴

buried in the early Christian writings. For palaeo-
graphical purposes sew manuscripts of the classics
are to be compared with the earliest biblical and

patristic msS, which latter are osten nearly or'quite 3
contemporary with the authors. The renewed study y
of history als0‚ to- be fruitsul must lead away from Ι
arid or florid compendiums to the living sources. The ,

‘monumenta Germaniae’ have long been issued to

schools in cheap editions and England has in Beda's ῑ

history, abbats ol Wearmouth and letter to Ecgberct‚

documents of lar greater worth, both as regards form ³
and matter, than the orzgines of Germany or any other ἶ
European nation. The sear that boys or girls may ι
‘spoil their Latin style’ by reading late Latin seems μ

chimerical. Il unclassical forms are pointed out as

they occur, the classical forms are imprinted only the r

deeper in the memory: we do not find that Homer,
Pindar, Herodotus Theocritus, corrupt our Greek

prose.

number ol homilies ascribed to Beda are printed sor the first rime.
