dial 1v 37 four days after the burial of Theophanes, his wife determined 5 r
to change the marble laid on his tomb: quod uidelicet marmor corpori
eius supcrpositam dum fuisset ablatum, tanta ex corpore ipsius lra-
grantia odoris emanauit, ac si ex putrescente carne illius pro
uermibus aromata ferbuissent. Gregory examined the workmen
in the presence of clergy, nobles and people: quiet eadem odoris 10
fragrantia miro modo se repletos fuisse testati sunt. ib. 4.
Merulus a monk, devoted to tears and prayers and psalmody, saw in a
vision a crown of white flowers descending from heaven on his head.
Fourteen years after his death tanta...de...sepulchro illius fragrantia
suauitatis emanauit, ac si illic florum omniurn fuissent odora· 15
menta congregata. Sometimes the fragrant odour is related to have
been perceived at the time of death. Thus at the death ofa certain
Servulus it is related (Aelfric Hom 1198) “Then was the house filled
with a wondrous odaur so that all the corpsebearers were filled with the
winsome fragrance aud the odours ceased uot in their nostrils till theco
holy body was buried”. Similarly at the death of the nun Romula
(ibid 548). A lilre fragrance is said to have pervaded the whole island
of Crowland after the death of St Guthlac Goodwin pp 86-90.
